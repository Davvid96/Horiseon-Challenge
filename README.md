## Description:

As per the challenge criteria I have been asked to take existing code of a simple web page and refactor it.

As per the scenario in this challenge, a marketing agency has 'hired me' to refactor their existing site to make it more accessible. Which basically means that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

The **User Story** read as follows:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### This was the Sample End-Result given by the agency:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

### Code:

#### There were a number of issues that needed addressing in the ***HTML*** file itself in order to achieve a fully **Refactored** and **Accessible** website:

*  Made sure that the HTML file has Semantic HTML elements throughout, as well as a logical structure.
*  Adjusted Image and icon elements to contain accessible `alt` attributes.
*  Made sure Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
*  Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.

#### Secondly it was time to adjust the ***CSS*** Style sheet:

* The CSS selectors and properties have been consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
* Appropriate headings have been given in a logical order, to keep a concise structure of the styles sheet.
* Excess/Repetitive CSS selectors have been either removed or grouped together to reduce line count.

## Conclusion:
Effectively this was my first piece of work which I had to *Refactor* to follow a set of guidelines. A very fun and educational activity, which naturally boosted my skills as well as confidence. Which will hopefully come useful in the future challenges to come.


## Deployment:
